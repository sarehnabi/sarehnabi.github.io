I am a Research Scientist at Amazon Ads; completed my postdoc under Dr. Lihong Li’s supervision in Sep.2023. I joined Amazon Ads as part of the early career scientist program launched in 2021. My current research focuses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Languae Models (LLM) applications in ads.

Previously, I worked as an Applied Research Scientist at Microsoft from 2018-2021; my work focused on integrating machine learning solutions with Dynamics 365 business products. I received my Ph.D. in Operations Management from the University of Washington in 2018 under Prof. Hamed Mamani’s supervision. My Ph.D. research focused on the applications of contextual bandits in dynamic pricing and online advertising. My previous educational background is an undergrad in Math from the Sharif University of Technology in Iran and masters in Math and Economics from Simon Fraser University in Canada.
